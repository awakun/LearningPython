# LearningPython

Mostly notes, may be incoherent as I journey to learn Python!

## Purpose

This repository contains notes, code snippets, and various artifacts feel free to use anything you find useful here.

## Goal

My eventual goal is to produce a game and contribute to at least 2 open source projects this year.
Looking at available game engines compatible with Python I think my best option will be learning [Godot](https://github.com/touilleMan/godot-python) (eventually).
Another possibilty is Unity, but that requires IronPython which currently only supports Python 2.x. [IronPython3](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3) is under development but appears rough at the moment.

## Process

Much of this is going to be review for me, I've worked with Python for some smaller bits in the past, but I want to have a good understanding so even the infamous Hello World will show up here.
